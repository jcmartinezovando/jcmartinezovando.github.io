### **Modeling numerical variables**

In this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.

The `scatterplot` below shows the relationship between HS graduate rate in all 50 US states and DC and the \% of residents who live below the poverty line (*income below \$23,050 for a family of 4 in 2012*).
