# Case 2: A purchase plan with decreasing unit costs  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

A manufacturing manager is in charge of minimizing the purchasing costs (raw materials plus storage costs) of the following four months.

In `Table 2` can be found the cost of one unit of raw material and the demand of raw material for each month. Storage costs are equal to 2 EUR for each unit stored at the end of the month. Any unit of raw material purchased at given month can be used to cover the demand of the same month, or be stored to cover the demand of months to come. At the beginning of month 1 there is no stock, and there are no minimum stock requirements for any month.

![**Table 2**](./figures/cd2007_semana03_case1.PNG)

For the next four months, the supplier of raw materials has made an
special offer: 

> All units purchased above 200 in any given month will have a discounts of 2 EUR. For instance, if a purchase of 350 units is ordered in month 1, the first 200 units will be sold for 12 EUR each, and the following 150 will be sold for 10 EUR each.

## Case objective

> Define the decision variables (provide a brief definition of each set of defined variables), objective function and constraints of a linear programming model that minimizes total purchasing costs.

## A `LP` model

Take a *decision* on the `variables` 
$$
\boldsymbol{x} = (q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4,s_1,s_2,s_3,\iota_2,\iota_3,\iota_4)'
$$
that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\min f(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4,s_1,s_2,s_3,\iota_2,\iota_3,\iota_4) & = & \boldsymbol{c}'\boldsymbol{x} \\
\end{eqnarray}

such that

\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x} \text{ \ dir \ } \boldsymbol{b},
\end{eqnarray}

where

\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{c} & = & (6,8,10,12,2,2,2,1000,1000,1000)',

# Mixed type linear programming model

> The formulation of `linear programming` states implicitly that `decision variables` $x_j$ are real.

> The `mixed integer linear programming` (`MILP`) is an extension to the `LP` model in which it is allowed to combine `real` and `integer` decision variables. This alternative is far more flexible, with advantage for application in real life situations.

* A special case of integer variables are binary variables, integer variables that can take only `0` and `1` values. Using binary variables widens considerably the possibilities of linear programming model building. Through binary variables can be modeled decision-making processes, and logical constraints can be introduced.

**Steps for finding solutions**

1. A first step to solve a `MILP` is solving its relaxed form. The relaxed `MILP` is a `LP` with the same objective function and constraints where all decision variables are real or continuous.

2. A particular interesting subset satisfies the
following properties:
 
 - All righthand side values $b_i$ are integer

 - The constraint coefficients matrix $A$ is **totally unimodular**, i.e. when any square submatrix of $A$ (sometimes called minor) has determinant `-1`, `0` or `+1`.
 
3. For `LP` not satisfying this property, more generic strategies have to be developed. The `branch and bound procedure` was introduced by Ailsa H Lang and Alison G Doig (1960), for example. Later the cutting plane and the branch and cut strategies were introduced. All these strategies start from the relaxation of the `MILP`, which provides a lower or upper bound (for the $\min$ and $\max$ problems, respectively) of the optimal value of the objective function. Later on, several linear programs are defined by adding constraints to the initial relaxed linear program, in order to find the solution of the `MILP`.

## Example

Les us consider the previously explored problem, in which we aim at `maximizing`:
$$
f(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)
=
x_1 + 9 x_2 + x_3
$$
subject to
\begin{eqnarray}
x_1 + 2 x_2 + 3 x_3 &\leq& 9 \\
3 x_1 + 2 x_2 + 2 x_3 &\leq& 15.
\end{eqnarray}

```{r}
f.obj <- c(1, 9, 1)
f.con <- matrix (c(1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
f.dir <- c("<=", "<=")
f.rhs <- c(9, 15)


library("lpSolve")
example.sol <- lp ("max", f.obj, f.con, f.dir, f.rhs)

# Case 3: A production plan with extra capacity  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

You are in charge of planning the production of a chemical product for the next four months. The monthly demand and the purchasing unit costs of raw material are listed in `Table 3`. The capacity of the plant is of 1,300 tonnes (t.) per month. 

The demand of a month can be covered with the production of the same month, and also with production of past months. The storage costs are of 2K EUR per tonne stocked at the end of the month. 

The stock of finished product at the beginning of the first month is of 200 T, and it is expected to hold the same quantity at the end of the fourth month. There are no stocks of raw material, so all stocks are of finished product.

![**Table 3**](./figures/cd2007_semana03_case2.PNG)

## Objectives

> 1. Obtain the linear programming model that allows to obtain the production plan which minimizes the sum of production and storage costs.

> 2. What is the meaning of the dual variables of the constraints defined in the model?

As the demand is proven to be irregular, the plant management is considering the possibility of adding extra capacity to the plant, introducing a new shift. This new shift would increase plant capacity in 400 T per month, but also would include an extra fixed cost of 500K EUR. For legal reasons, it is not possible to add extra capacity in a month if it has been added in the previous month.

> 3. Modify the model obtained previously to include the possibility of including extra shifts, and assess the practicality of adding extra shifts.

# Case 4: Production of two models of chairs  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

A company produces two models of chairs: `4P` and `3P`. The model `4P` needs 4 legs, 1 seat and 1 back. On the other hand, the model `3P` needs 3 legs and 1 seat. The company has a initial stock of 200 legs, 500 seats and 100 backs. If the company needs more legs, seats and backs, it can buy standard wood blocks, whose cost is 80 EUR per block. The company can produce 10 seats, 20 legs and 2 backs from a standard wood block.

The cost of producing the model `4P` is 30 EUR/chair, meanwhile the cost of the model `3P` is 40 EUR/chair. Finally, the company informs that the minimum number of chairs to produce is 1,000 units per month.

## Objectives

> 1. Define a linear programming model, which minimizes the total cost (the production costs of the two chairs, plus the buying of new wood blocks).

Due to the economic crisis, the company has considered the possibility to just producing a single chair model between `3P` and `4P`.

> 2. Define the new linear programming model for producing only a single chair model, which minimizes the total cost.

Finally, the new CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of the company has decided that the factory needs to produce of the model `4P` a minimum of 4 times the quantity of the model `3P`.

> 3. Define the new linear programming model, which minimizes the total cost when producing `4P` four times the quantity of `3P`.

# Duality concept

In a general (a.k.a. canonical) form, a *maximization linear programming model* can be formulated as
\begin{eqnarray}
\max f(\boldsymbol{x}) & = & \boldsymbol{c}'\boldsymbol{x} \nonumber \\ 
\text{s.t.}& & \boldsymbol{A}'\boldsymbol{x} \leq \boldsymbol{b} \nonumber \\
& & \boldsymbol{x}\geq 0.
\end{eqnarray}

The above problem can be expresses as a *minimization linear programming model* as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\min g(\boldsymbol{x}) & = & \boldsymbol{u}'\boldsymbol{x} \nonumber \\ 
\text{s.t.}& & \boldsymbol{u}'\boldsymbol{A} \leq \boldsymbol{c} \nonumber \\
& & \boldsymbol{u}\geq 0,
\end{eqnarray}
which is called the **dual** of the former *linear programming model*.

The association of directions in constraint components between and *original* (*primal*) and *dual* formulation are summarized in the next table.


![**Table: Directions of *primal* and *dual* model formulation **](./figures/cd2007_semana03_dualtable.PNG)

## Example

Let us consider the linear programming model studied in the previous session:
\begin{eqnarray}
\max f(x_1,x_2) & = & 20 x_1 + 60 x_2 \nonumber \\
\text{s.t. a)} & & 30 x_1 + 20 x_2 \leq 2700 \nonumber \\ 
\text{b)} & & 5 x_1 + 10 x_2 \leq 850 \nonumber \\ 
\text{c)} & & x_1 + x_2 \geq 95 \nonumber \\
\text{d)} & & x_1,x_2 \geq 0. \nonumber \\ 
\end{eqnarray}

> This is called the *primal model*.

The *dual version* of this model is constructed in the following way:

* The `two domain variables` of the *primal* are turned into `three new domain variables` for the *dual* as follows: One `new domain` variable for each `conatraint function` (a)-(c).

* The `three new dowmain variables` are labeled as
  - $y_a$ for constraint (a)
  - $y_b$ for constraint (b)
  - $y_c$ for constraint (c)
  
* The *dual version* will have now instead `two constraints` (one for each `domain variable` attained to the *primal version*).

Thus, following **Table: Directions of *primal* and *dual* model formulation **, we get the *dual specification* of the *primal linear proframming model*:

\begin{eqnarray}
\min g(y_a,y_b, y_c) & = & 2700 y_a + 850 y_b + 95 y_c \nonumber \\
\text{s.t. 1)} & & 30 y_a + 5 y_b + y_c \geq 20 \nonumber \\ 
\text{2)} & & 20 y_a + 10 y_b + y_c \geq 60 \nonumber \\ 
\text{3)} & & y_a,y_b \geq 0 \text{ and } y_c \leq 0. \nonumber \\ 
\end{eqnarray}

## Properties

> I. The `dual` of a `dual linear programming model` corresponds to the `primal version`.

> II. Optimum of `primal` and `dual` are the same, when the `linear programming model` has a bounded optimum.
